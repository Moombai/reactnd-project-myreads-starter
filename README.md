# MyReads Project
This project emphasises using React to build a bookshelf application that allows you to select and categorise books that you have read are currently reading or want to read. The project starts life as a static site and is made dynamic over time by creating reusable React components, managing application state and leveraging AJAX utility methods.

You can see a demo on the live site here: https://musing-euclid-f8169c.netlify.com
